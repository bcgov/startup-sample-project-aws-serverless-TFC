# startup-sample-project-aws-serverless
Lambda serverless app meant to accelerate teams onboarding to the BC Gov SEA AWS space.

## Setup
- Fork this repo
- Enable github actions
#### Github Secrets
you'll need to add two github secrets:
  - `LICENCEPLATE` is the 6 character licensecho "x"e plate associated with your project set e.g. `abc123`
  - `TFC_TEAM_TOKEN` is the token used to access the terraform cloud runner.
  - To access the TFC_Team_Token: Log to AWS> Search for Parameter Store > the key is under /octk/tfc/team_token
  - Once the app has been built, you should be able to log into AWS with your IDIR account (2FA). Once in AWS search for Cloudfront and then click on Distributions (If you can not see it click the hamburger on the top left corner). The Distributions dashboard shows the Domain name, you can use that domain name to interact with you app.


#### Pipeline
The github actions will trigger on a pull request creation and merge.
- Creating a pull request will run a `terraform plan` and outline everything that will be deployed into your AWS accounts, but will not create anything.
- Merging into `main` will run a `terraform apply` and your AWS assets will be deployed into your `dev` and `sandbox` accounts.

NOTE: make sure you are creating pull requests/ merging within your fork


#### Testing
For how to use the test associated to this project, please check the README file under `functional-tests`
